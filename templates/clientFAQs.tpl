<p><strong>Questions About Working With Remote Staff</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="1_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em> : Am I guaranteed specific work related outputs and results by the contractors I hire from Remote Staff? </em></span>
<div id="1_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> No. Due to Remote Staff having no direct involvement in the direction, guidance, and management of the working tasks of contracted staff, Remote Staff cannot be held accountable for outcomes rendered by contracted staff the client has personally selected to hire, however we guarantee staff are actually working for you or you do not pay for the time in question.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="2_a"><strong><em>Question:</em></strong><em> Is there, any assistance provided on daily work tasks and/or project management solutions offered by Remote Staff? </em></span>
<div id="2_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> No. Due to the fact Remote staff is not liable for the daily work activities between your business and the contracted staff, we do not get involved with any of the work tasks or management of your output expectations. Our remote staffing solutions offers you HR support services as well as technologies to keep staff accountable and ensure that staff are online, on time and performing work related tasks. 
</div>
</li>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="3_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Who is responsible for the work performance quality of the contracted staff?</em></span>
<div id="3_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> It is important to note that staff will be working under your direction, guidance, and management. As the client, you will be responsible for giving instructions regarding to; what work tasks needs to be completed, the standard of work required and your minimum expectations the contractor must meet to be part of your team. At Remote Staff, we have no direct involvement when it comes to instructing staff on specific work related tasks set by you the client. 
</div>
</li>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="4_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Do Clients have to provide any computers, equipment and software to the offshore contracted staff to perform their work tasks? </em></span>
<div id="4_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> No. At remote staff we confirm that our contracted staff have professional working environments by personally visiting their homes to validate their computer equipment and Internet connection speeds are all of a professional working standard. There have been some cases where clients have supplied equipment and software necessary to complete the job but this is solely the choice of the client. 
</div>
</li>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="5_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Will the client have direct access to the contracted staff they hire or will the client be required to use Remote staff as a "middle man" every time the client needs to communicate to the hired contracted staff? </em></span>
<div id="5_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Remote Staff has no direct involvement in the daily work activities and communication between your business and the contracted staff. As the client you will have direct access to the contracted staff member any time during their working shift. Remote Staff will set up a new Skype ID, Remote Staff Chat ID and Gmail account for the contracted staff and these details will be passed onto the client so you can communicate directly with your contracted staff during their working shifts. For those clients who would prefer to have direct access to their staff without the involvement of the remote staff, there is the option of a $5,000 buyout fee per staff member. 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="6_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: What are the procedures used to communicate with contracted staff only accessible via online?  </em></span>
<div id="6_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Most clients use Skype or the Remote Staff Chat System to text chat or make voice calls to their staff. It is recommended when training staff use screen share tools, which is a great way to demonstrate changes to work tasks and procedures. We recommend that it is best to use all forms of communication with staff as sometimes an email is adequate and other times voice communication is necessary. Just be mindful that it is not a good idea to mix autonomy and isolation when dealing with staff working abroad. 
 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="7_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Can Remote Staff contractors competently read, write and speak English to communicate at a level I can feel confident with?</em></span>
<div id="7_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, all our Remote Staff contractors are pre-screened to ensure they are able to communicate in the English language at a minimum level required to work with our clients. In saying this, it is important to understand that this does not mean that the contractors will understand and communicate at a level that you may experience with your locally hire staff. Due to cultural differences, people may speak English but not think English.
 
</div>
</li>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="8_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Do I communicate with staff by making international phone calls?  </em></span>
<div id="8_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Most clients and their contracted offshore staff communicate for free via the Skype online communication network. Therefore, there is no need to make expensive international calls to communicate with your staff. 
 
</div>
</li>



<li>
<span class="faq" id="9_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Where do Remote Staff contractors work from?  </em></span>
<div id="9_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Most contracted staff work from their own homes located nationally across their counties of origin. Most contracted staff work in major city locations with 30% of staff working from provinces or remote destinations. 
 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="10_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Are Remote Staff contractors exclusively working for me?  </em></span>
<div id="10_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, Remote Staff contractors are exclusively working for you during their shifts as well as in your time zone. At Remote Staff we have technologies in place to keep staff accountable as well as ensure that staff are online, on time and performing work related tasks. Just be mindful that in most cases part-time staff you hire will usually have another client they work for, to make up the difference between full-time and part-time work and subsidize their income.
 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="11_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: I have never worked with offshore contracted staff before and need a better understanding as to their capabilities and what I can expect when working with offshore staff?  </em></span>
<div id="11_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> During our stringent screening processes Remote Staff make it a priority to hire educated intelligent people with experience in the appropriate fields. We work very hard to assist you to find the best person for your job and that your expectations and standards are suited as closely as possible.<br />
<br />
  
The biggest difference you will experience with Remote Staff contractors is that they work from outside your office location. This may result in having to readjust to a slower start compared with what you may expect with hiring someone to work from your own office. This may also require you to spend more time training and micro managing someone working abroad. Other than these factors, once a relationship has been established you could expect the same commitment and dedication towards your company goals and outcomes much the same as you would expect from your local office based staff.

 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="12_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: How do we train and supervise the contracted staff working outside the confines of our local office?  </em></span>
<div id="12_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> We recommend using free online screen share tools as one way to show someone how a job needs to be performed to your liking. Remote Staff has invested heavily in developing operational systems and technologies to keep contractors accountable, all whilst working online from locations anywhere in the World. Technologies such as our; 3minute screenshots to help the client keep track of the work quality outputs being performed by the contractor; 20-30minute activity tracker, which is a tool designed to help you keep on top of your staffâ€™s priorities throughout the day and 5minute web cam shots, for staff working night shift to ensure they are in the right working state. These technologies are all useful tools to assist you in monitoring your staff.

<li>
<span class="faq" id="13_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: My business requires my staff to use Apple Mac Computers. Does this mean I have to provide staff with an Apple Mac computer?   </em></span>
<div id="13_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> No the staff will have their own equipment, but keep in mind that if you require staff to have specialized computer equipment such as Apple Mac Computers, you would need to mention this prerequisite during the recruitment process so we filter out those staff who do not meet your needs. Please be mindful that there are fewer Apple Mac users in these parts of the world due mainly to the cost restraints in acquiring such equipment.

<p><strong>Questions about Remote Staff invoicing</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="14_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Are contractors hired on per hour, monthly or yearly basis? What happens if the client only requires contracted staff for 1 day per week or 2hr per day? Is the client invoiced per assignment completed or per week/month worked?  </em></span>
<div id="14_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> As an effort to attract quality committed contractors to work with our clients over the long-term, Remote Staff only focuses on hiring full-time or part-time staff. It is our strict policy not to hire staff out for 1 day a week or 2 hrs per day as this is not a sustainable long term staffing solution and therefore we do not involve ourselves with this kind of short term project based work. <br /><br />
Full-time contractors are required to work from Mon-Fri, 8 hrs a day and their shift is 9:00hr long with a 1hr lunch break and two short 10min breaks. Part-time contractors are expected to work from Mon-Fri, 4 hrs a day, with a 10min break every 2hr worked. For these staffing services a client will be invoiced on monthly basis. Remote Staff does not issue weekly invoices for wages, as our payroll system is design to be paid at the start of every month. 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="15_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: How often am I expected to pay contracted staff?  </em></span>
<div id="15_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> The client is required to make advanced payments on staff wage invoices at the beginning of every month.  As a Client there are three stages of invoicing. 
  <ul>
    <li>1st month is one month in advance e.g. 12th May-12th June</li>
    <li>2nd month is the pro-rata month invoice e.g. 13th June- 30th June</li>
    <li>3rd month invoice will be one month in advance starting from the 1st July- 31st July. </li>
  </ul><br />
  In the case staff members works overtime, the calculated overtime will be added onto next months invoice. In the case a staff member does not work their full hours, then the calculated un-worked hours will be credited back in the following months invoice. It is a policy of Remote Staff that you only pay for the hours worked.
  </div>
</li>

<li>
<span class="faq" id="16_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Why is the client invoiced one month up front?  </em></span>
<div id="16_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Remote Staff believe staff wages must never be delayed, especially when involved in international business and we consider Remote Staff monthly invoices to be the same as paying monthly staff wages. For Remote Staff to build a trusted name as a reliable staffing supplier, Remote Staff avoid bank rolling our clientâ€™s staff wages.<br />
<br />
 
The reason why Remote Staff uses the one month in advanced invoicing system is to attract quality contractors and clients alike. Remote Staff Invoices paid in advance serve as a form of security, which is an essential detail in helping eliminate the risks associated with performing business abroad. More importantly, security is a crucial ingredient used to encourage quality candidates to commit to building long-term careers working with our international clients. <br /><br />
Remote Staff avoids dealing with clients who consistently pay their monthly invoices late. If an invoice is not paid before the 25th of any given month, Remote Staff will suspend the client from working with the contracted staff, until the overdue invoice is paid in full. If the overdue invoice is not paid for a period of one week after the suspension date, we will cease our agreement and seek the final invoice payment in full immediately. 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="17_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: If a staff member does not work the hours they are scheduled to work during the month that I have paid for in advance, how does Remote Staff rectify this issue?  </em></span>
<div id="17_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> At Remote Staff, you only pay for the hours staff work. If for any reason a staff member does not fulfil their rostered hours scheduled, then you will be credited for the hours not worked in the following monthly invoice. 
 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="18_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: How are the hourly rates of staff calculated?  </em></span>
<div id="18_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> At Remote Staff we calculate the hourly rate of staff using the following method:<br /><br />
 
<ul><em>The monthly Rate is multiplied by 12 (months) =yearly rate</em><br />
    <em>Yearly rate is divided by 52 (weeks) = weekly rate</em><br />
    <em>Weekly rate is divided by 5(days in a working week)= Daily rate</em><br />
    <em>Daily rate is divided by 8 (hrs for full-time) or 4 (hrs for part-time) = Hourly rate</em><br />
    <em>E.g. $1,000 x 12 / 52 / 5/ 8hr = $5.77 per hour.</em> </ul> <br />
	
	Using this method we calculate how many hours worked over any given month. Any extra hours worked are charged in the following months invoices and un-worked hours are credited back in the following months invoice.
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="19_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Who do I pay, the staff directly or Remote Staff /Think Innovations Company?  </em></span>
<div id="19_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Under no circumstances can you pay the staff directly because the company is invoicing you and not the contractors. If this were to occur it would be a breach of contract between the Client and Remote Staff/Think Innovations Company. All clients are required to pay each monthly invoice to Remote Staff/Think Innovations Company. This will also enable Remote Staff to take care of all payroll payments and procedures at the end of each month in the staffâ€™s local currencies.
 
</div>
</li>



<li>
<span class="faq" id="20_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Can incentives and commissions be paid to staff in addition to their regular wages? If so how will it be implemented? </em></span>
<div id="20_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. You will need to call our customer support department who will then inform our accounts department and your added commission or staff bonus will be included in the following months invoice.  All commission and bonuses will paid in its entirety to the staff without Remote Staff taking any percentage. Please keep in mind that under no circumstances can commissions and bonuses be paid to staff directly. 
 
</div>
</li>



<li>
<span class="faq" id="21_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: How do I know that the staff I hire are being paid a fair and reasonable wage? What are Remote Staffâ€™s margins?   </em></span>
<div id="21_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> At Remote Staff one of our priorities when hiring staff to our clients is building long tern sustainable working relationships for all parties involved. We take retention seriously and as a result we know that we must pay contractors fair and reasonable award Filipino and Indian wages. We understand that clients invest their resources into hiring people from Remote Staff and the last thing we want to do is sabotage the effort of our clients and staff by compromising or underpaying staff wages. <br /><br />
As an effort to fully comply with and ensure that Remote Staff are paying fair and reasonable Filipino wages to the sub-contractors we had the vice-president of HSBC Philippines payroll Department review our payroll. They were happy to inform us that our payment to sub-contractors is fair and more than reasonable, so much so that the reviewer jokingly stated that if ever he left HSBC, Remote Staff would be his first port of call. <br /><br />
At remote staff we do not open up our books and disclose our margins, as we would not expect our clients to do so for us. What we can say on the matter is that our margins are the same fixed rate that is added to the monthly invoice of every sub-contractor we hire out. We do not add percentage margins on top of hourly rates of our sub contractors. So if you hire low-end staff or high end staff our fixed margin does not change.

<p><strong>Questions about Remote Staff security</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="faq" id="22_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: Does Remote Staff guarantee contractors are responsible and trustworthy?   </em></span>
<div id="22_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> At Remote Staff we eliminate the risks associated in working with contractors abroad, via home visits to confirm staff IDs, addresses as well as contacting past employers and referees to confirm previous work history. During these home visits we also validate computer equipment and Internet speeds are of a minimum professional standard required to perform work tasks. If you wish we are able to perform police clearances for an additional fee of $10. All staff sign individual contracts with Remote Staff only after they pass our stringent screening processes and as a result of these measures, we have never had an incident where contracted staff have breached our clients IP or proprietary business knowledge in anyway, proving that remote staff is a trusted supplier by staff and clients alike over time.
 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="23_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: What measures are in place to ensure IP confidentiality?   </em></span>
<div id="23_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Remote Staff take any breach of confidentiality as a serious matter. In the unlikely occurrence of a breach of IP confidentiality, we would have our senior representative go to the home of the contracted staff and thoroughly investigate by searching the computers and hard drives of the staff member in question of an IP breach. If the staff member has been found to be acting in-appropriately by trading or selling our client IP, Remote Staff will take legal action on behalf of the client to stop any further unauthorized illegal activities. Remote Staff has secure measures in place to ensure these unethical behaviors are minimized and the Remote Staffing experience is a safety zone for both staff and clients alike. In addition to this we have a number of lawyers on retainers in the unlikely case of any breach of contract.
 
</div>
</li>


<li>
<span class="faq" id="24_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: What are the procedures undertaken in the situation of an unworkable relationship with a sub contacted staff member?  </em></span>
<div id="24_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> You have the ability to cease any contract with a staff member with just 24hr notice with in the first 4 months of hire. After 4 months you will need to give 2 weeks notice before terminating a staff member. Also if you are not happy with your current staff member we offer a staff replacement guarantee.

<span class="faq" id="25_a"><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>: With online security becoming a global issue, how do I know my personal and private company details are safely guarded?</em></span>
<div id="25_a_div">
<strong>Answer:</strong> At Remote staff we understand that with the growth of companies doing business globally online, there are challenges which present themselves and none more so that online security.  As a result Remote Staff invests heavily in an IT department, who monitor and maintain the online security practices of the Remote Staff company to reassure clients that our working platform, database and servers are a secure place to do business safe from corrupt online people and practices. <br /><br />
Some of the security procedures and practices Remote Staff use are as follows:<br /><br />
  <ul>
    <li>6 full time in house IT staff developing secure technologies as well as maintaining and monitoring servers, database and working platforms. </li>
    <li>Front end SSL security information sent to and from servers and computers cannot be intercepted in transition.</li>
    <li>New and updated security patches are entered into the servers and database every week ensuring that security hatches cannot be violated by corrupt intentions and hacks.</li>
    <li>Remote staff encrypt the personal database of every client to ensure that personal and private information relative to clients is not able to be accessed without the right encryption security and only visible to a very few selected staff.</li>
    <li>2 factor authentication using security tokens preventing password hacks. </li>
    <li>Remote Staff has 4 Servers, which are a controlled environment where only a selected few people can access the database. </li>
    <li>In the event of a server going down we have in place a multiple replicating database back up system which delays our back up servers 30 minutes and 1hr so there will be no disruption to your staff or business in any way shape or form. </li>
    <li>Own in house mail server spam filters and anti virus. </li>
