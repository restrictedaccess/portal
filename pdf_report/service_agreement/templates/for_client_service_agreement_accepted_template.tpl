	<p><span style="font-weight:bold; text-transform:capitalize;">Dear {$lead.fname} {$lead.lname},</span></p><br/>
	<p>This is to confirm that we received your acknowledgement to the Remote Staff Service Agreement at <span style="font-weight:bold; text-transform:capitalize;">{$date_accepted|date_format:"%I:%M:%S %p  %B %e, %Y"}</span>. We are now mobilizing the team to get your remote staff started.</p><br/>
	<p>To this stage, we have placed over 420 staff with clients all around the world and it is a pleasure to add you to the list. With all the success, we still have some clients who have struggled to make it work. But by far the greater majority has been able to ramp up to the next stages of growing their business. <br>
	<p>As you might already know, very few succeed by just being lucky, most would need careful planning and preparation. I recommend to get started and get ready by reading and following below:</p><br/>
	<p>1. If not already done I would recommend that you follow the link to this page <a href="http://www.remotestaff.com.au/management-tips.php">http://www.remotestaff.com.au/management-tips.php</a> and please have a read.</p><br/>
  	<p>2. As discussed, your staff will work with you directly. You will be supported by our Staffing Consultant Team whose main job is to assist you with any HR issues and online tools questions. (Online phones, Skype, Sharing files, sharing computer screens with your staff, monitoring your staff, recording your staff’s phone conversation etc.) The Staffing Consultant team will get in touch with you before the start date of your staff member.</p><br/>
	<p>4. The first 2 to 4 weeks are very important in developing the foundation of good working relationship. The tips page mentioned above will assist, but please remember the more you invest in the early stages the earlier you will reap the benefits of the leverage offshore staffing provides.</p><br/>
	<p>5. No recruitment process will ensure that the right person will be placed correctly the first time 100%.  It does not exist locally and the Remote Staff is no different.  You will only really know after you have started working with your staff.  If at any time you feel that something is not working right, connect with the Client Staff Relations Team. The earlier the better. They will help to check if it is something that can be addressed and resolved to satisfy your need and goal.  If the situation becomes unworkable don't forget that you can terminate and replace staff with 1 day notice.</p><br/>
	<p>Success for us is getting the right person for you and helping you maintain and develop a good long term work relationship with your staff to achieve your goals.  When this happens, you win, the staff wins and we gain a long term satisfied client. Great all around.</p><br/>
	<p>I hope the above has been useful and as mentioned before please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions.</p><br/>
	<p>Cheers,</p><br/>
  	<p>Remote Staff Team</p>
