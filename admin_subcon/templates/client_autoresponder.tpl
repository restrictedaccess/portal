  A. 3 minute screen shots to help you keep track of the work being performed by your staff<br />
  B. Activity Tracker, which is a tool designed to help you keep on top of your staff&rsquo;s priorities throughout the day and allow you to view their activities<br />
  C. Optional 5 minute web cam shots for staff working night shift to ensure they are in the right working state<br />
  D. Online time sheets which are linked to our payroll and client invoices to ensure that you are only paying the staff for hours worked. <br />
  E. Work Flow Task page that will allow you to list or assign tasks and to do lists to your staff member. <br />
  F. Remote Staff Screen Capture software that will allow you to create video instructions to be shared to your staff via a link or via the Workflow task page <br />

  As with any new staff member, the first 2 weeks of hire are crucial to building a successful long lasting working relationship. We expect that there will be a certain level of micromanagement and training conducted by you or your department manager(s). This will assist your staff member to achieve a smooth transition into the new job.<br />
  When it comes to any questions or issues with regards to attendance compliance, working schedules, commissions and payroll this must only be addressed directly with the Client Staff Relations Team and must never be discussed with your staff member.<br />
  Shortly Remote Staff will be sending you your first month invoice that we expect to be paid on or before the first day of your staff member. We accept payments made through electronic bank transfers, direct debit and credit cards. <br />
